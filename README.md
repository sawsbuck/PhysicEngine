***makeshift Physics Engine*** 

Well, I am making a physics engine. Why? I don't know because initially, I intended to make a game based on physics puzzles but decided to make my physics engine for it.

I realized the Game would be challenging, but I started making the physics engine, so why stop now? 

It will be fun. You are more than welcome to contribute or suggest changes, but if you want to see a feature or any changes, you can try to make them yourself. Even if you fail, you'll learn something.

I am still learning how it works and what I will do with this project, but It's just good fun for now. Join me in improving this project. Also, use and look at issues. That's it.

yeah the project is entirely in python i dont know how to work with multiple languages so lets keep it that way
